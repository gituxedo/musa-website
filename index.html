<p class="text-center important">We are the Mathematics Undergraduate Student Association of the University of California, Berkeley!</p>
<div class="resource">
<p>We strive to improve the overall quality of studying mathematics here as an undergraduate, especially by
advocating for issues that benefit the entire undergraduate math community, not only the subset that attends our
events.</p>
<p>Joining MUSA is an excellent way to connect with other math enthusiasts. You can learn about the many
opportunities for math students, including little tricks that will help you survive the rigorous math curriculum
here.</p>
<p><strong>Our office</a>,
938 Evans</strong>, is usually open, selling hoodies and food &mdash; but we encourage students to come in just
to chat about math or life. We won't bite!<br>
We also have a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/yywDyPwMBz">Discord server</a> for students to chat and socialize! Office hours are held 10 AM - 4 PM on weekdays in our office. 
<p>We encourage students to come to our <strong>Thursday events, held in 1015 Evans</strong>
where you can meet fellow math geeks and get valuable information. Our events are open to the public,
<strong>not just declared math majors</strong> &mdash;
so don't be a stranger!</p>
<p>You can also purchase t-shirts and hoodies online with our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_BwBPdDOPkncs2Srt7_BYZUTX8nRUcSGG1eE_jA3mCK01SQ/viewform">MUSA Merchandise Mail Order Form</a>.</p>
<p>MUSA strives to make the math department as inclusive as possible. How are we doing? Let us know with our anonymous <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/TSTxZje3CCNjBwhF3">feedback form</a>.</p>
<!-- <p>We are still looking for mentors and mentees for our Berkeley Undergraduate Mathementoring Program, BUMP. Learn more about BUMP <a href="bump.html">here</a>. -->

<h3>Math Monday</h3>
<p>The Math Monday undergraduate lecture series is the flagship event of MUSA. It is a series of talks, every Monday at 5 PM, given by professors and other academics about mathematical research and special topics. (<a href="monday.html">Archive</a>)</p>
<!-- <h5>To be announced</h5> -->
<h4>Development of new mathematics motivated by real-life problems: Micro-swimming soft robots, vascular stents, and bioartificial pancreas</h4>
<p>Sunčica Čanić</p>
<p>Late October</p>
<p>Abstract: Real-life problems are an important driving force in the development of new mathematics. With the recent developments of new technologies, biomedical engineering and medicine, the need for new mathematical and numerical methodologies to aid these developments has never been greater. Real-life problems are often times mathematically rich and very complex. In this talk I will focus on describing mathematical problems motivated by biomedical applications involving the interaction between fluids, such as blood, and various structures, such as cardiovascular tissue.

<h3>Featured Problem(s)</h3>
<p>At MUSA, we love to talk about tricky math problems of all levels! Here's some of our favorite problems. If you can't figure them out yourself, try asking at office hours and see if anyone else can make heads or tails of them.</p>
<p>A fair coin is repeatedly flipped until 2019 consecutive coin flips are the same. Compute the probability that the first and last flips of the coin come up differently.<br>
