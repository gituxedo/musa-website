    <h1>Officers</h1>
    <p>We hold office hours and run events with the help of volunteers from the Berkeley mathematics community. Most of our officers are familiar with many of the math courses required for the math and applied math majors.</p>
    <p>Becoming a MUSA officer is a great way to get involved. If you're interested, keep an eye on our mailing list in August!</p>
    <p>We also have an incomplete list of <a href="former_officers.html">former officers</a>.</p>
